# Conjugation Practice

This is a tool to help practice Brazilian portuguese verb conjugations

# Usage

The goal is to turn this into a website

The verb list in the `pt_1000verbs.csv` file is parsed and then uploaded to google firebase using `parse_and_upload`. See the comments in that file for more on how that script works. The verb list is also is turned into a JSON file `parsed_verbs.json`included here in case anyone would like to use that.

# Contributing

Any conjugation corrections or additions should be done to `pt_1000verbs.csv` as that is considered the single source of truth

# Attributions

The verb list in `pt_1000verbs.csv` is borrowed from https://github.com/Troyciv/PT_ConjugationTrainer_Anki. Many thanks to the hard work of those who compiled this list.
